## Goals
To make a time-pressured, nihilistic trivia game and experiment with different html elements (radio buttons, button groups, button values) and continuing experimentation with jQuery (timers).

## Status
So far my timer displays, functions, and calls functions when intended. The reset button jQuery is ready, and I will add a button for it once I finish adding radio input value addition funcintionality to the answerCheck function. Bonus goal: when this all finishes, I want to display it on a z-index > window that will fade in the results and the answer button.
